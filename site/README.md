## Setup

* Follow this: https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/
* Remember to `bundle update` periodically.

## Editing the website

The left-hand column index can be modified by editing `_data/nav_docs.yml`.
These items point to files in the docs/ directory.

To edit and test your changes, type:
```
bundle exec jekyll -w serve
```

Then, as you edit the files, the site will be available at
`http://0.0.0.0:4000/bistro/`.
